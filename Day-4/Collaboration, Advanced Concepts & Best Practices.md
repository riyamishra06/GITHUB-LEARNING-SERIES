## Collaboration Workflows

### 1. Feature Branch Workflow
# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/user-authentication

# Work on feature
git add .
git commit -m "Add user login functionality"

# Push to GitHub
git push origin feature/user-authentication
Explanation:

Creates a branch for a specific feature (user-authentication).
Commits changes and pushes to GitHub.
Create a Pull Request on GitHub for review and merging.

2. Forking Workflow (Open Source)
bash# Fork repository on GitHub, then:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/original-repo.git
git remote add upstream https://github.com/originalowner/original-repo.git
git checkout -b fix-bug
git add .
git commit -m "Fix critical bug in user validation"
git push origin fix-bug
Explanation:

Forks a repository to your GitHub account.
Clones your fork, adds the original repository as upstream.
Creates a branch, commits changes, and pushes to your fork.
Create a Pull Request to the original repository.

3. Git Flow
Structured branching:

main: Production code
develop: Integration branch
feature/*: New features
release/*: Release preparation
hotfix/*: Emergency fixes

Explanation: Git Flow organizes branches for large projects, separating stable code (main), development (develop), and specific tasks.

Advanced Git Concepts
1. Stashing
bash# Save current work
git stash

# List stashes
git stash list

# Apply latest stash
git stash pop
Explanation:

git stash: Saves uncommitted changes temporarily.
git stash list: Shows all stashed changes.
git stash pop: Applies and removes the latest stash.

2. Rebasing
bashgit rebase main
Explanation: Reapplies your branchâ€™s commits on top of main, creating a cleaner history (use cautiously to avoid conflicts).
3. Cherry-picking
bashgit cherry-pick commit-hash
Explanation: Applies a specific commit from another branch to your current branch.
4. Tags
bash# Create annotated tag
git tag -a v1.0 -m "Version 1.0 release"

# Push tags
git push origin --tags
Explanation:

git tag -a v1.0 -m ...: Marks a release point with a version number and message.
git push origin --tags: Uploads tags to GitHub.


Best Practices
1. Commit Messages
bashfeat: add user authentication system
fix: resolve login validation bug
docs: update README with installation steps
Explanation: Use conventional commits (e.g., feat, fix, docs) for clear, standardized messages.
2. .gitignore File
gitignorenode_modules/
.env
.vscode/
*.log
Explanation: Ignores files like dependencies, environment variables, and editor settings to keep the repository clean.
3. Repository Structure
textproject/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”œâ”€â”€ docs/
â”œâ”€â”€ tests/
â”œâ”€â”€ .gitignore
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
Explanation: Organizes code, documentation, and tests for clarity and maintainability.

Troubleshooting
1. Merge Conflicts
bashgit status
git add resolved-file.js
git commit -m "Resolve merge conflict"
Explanation: Identifies conflicted files, resolves them manually, and commits the resolution.
2. Undo Last Commit
bashgit reset --soft HEAD~1
Explanation: Undoes the last commit but keeps changes in your working directory.
3. Authentication Issues
bashgit config --global credential.helper cache
Explanation: Caches your GitHub credentials to avoid repeated login prompts.
